                    <h2>Artificial Intelligence Applications in 2022</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence  offers increased accuracy, availability, and ease of implementation. These advancements make artificial intelligence applications more readily applicable in modern businesses. Also, the improvements in neural network technology and computational power will make these applications cost-effective, more accurate, and more accessible to businesses in the future.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Today, too many people view artificial intelligence (AI) as another magical technology that’s being put to work with little understanding of how it works. They view AI as special and relegated to experts who have mastered and dazzled us with it. In this environment, AI has taken on an air of mysticism with promises of grandeur, and out of the reach of mere mortals.

                        The truth, of course, is there is no magic to AI. The term Artificial Intelligence was first coined in 1956 and since then the technology has progressed, disappointed, and re-emerged. As it was with electricity, the path to AI breakthroughs will come with mass experimentation. While many of those experiments will fail, the successful ones will have substantial impact.
                        
                        That’s where we find ourselves today. As others, like Andrew Ng have suggested, AI is the new electricity. In addition to it becoming ubiquitous and increasingly accessible, AI is enhancing and altering the way business is conducted around the world. It is enabling predictions with supreme accuracy and automating business processes and decision-making. The impact is vast, ranging from greater customer experiences, to intelligent products and more efficient services. And in the end, the result will be economic impact for companies, countries, and society.
                        
                        To be sure, organizations that drive mass experimentation in AI will win the next decade of market opportunity. To breakdown and help demystify AI, one needs to consider two key elements of the category: the componentry and the process. In other words, identifying what’s behind it and how it can be adopted.</p>
